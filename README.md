        <h2>How to Join A football Team<br><br>
          The first place to start when trying to get into a football academy is to join a local team. Academies scout for talent in local leagues. By playing for a local team, there's a good chance you will find yourself in these scouts' line of sight. To attract academy scouts, you will need to impress.</h2>

          <h2>How To Be Remained Motivated And Dedicated Towards Football<br><br>
            To stay motivated to play football, it's important to focus on setting achievable goals, celebrate small wins, and find ways to enjoy the process. Start by identifying specific areas you want to improve, such as increasing your speed, strengthening your kicking accuracy, or improving your ball handling. Break these larger goals down into smaller, actionable steps that you can work on consistently. Celebrate each milestone, no matter how small, to reinforce your progress and build momentum.<br><br>

Additionally, try to find ways to make your football practice and training sessions more enjoyable. Listen to upbeat music, try new drills or training methods, or practice with friends. Surrounding yourself with a positive, supportive team environment can also go a long way in maintaining your motivation. Remember that football is a sport that requires dedication and discipline, but by staying focused on your goals and finding ways to make the journey fun, you'll be more likely to stay motivated and engaged over the long term.</h2>

      <h2>How To Find A Football Coach<br><br>
      Coaching Education<br><br>
Coach Education plays an integral part in the development structure of football in the country. No matter how many matches one has played at the highest level, Coach Education adds to his/her experience and gives him/her the finer details in coaching. Coach Education ensures the future quality of football, which lies to a large extent in the hands of qualified coaches, who play a vital role in the development of players and the game. It provides a coach with the appropriate tools and knowledge for his/her development to become a professional in the World of Football.<br><br>

AFC’s Coach Education activities started in 1989 when the Confederation established its Technical Department and put it in charge of all Coach Education affairs. The AFC Coach Licencing Scheme was introduced in phases, with the first ‘C’ Licence course delivered in 1994. Following the ‘C’ course, the ‘B’ and ‘A’ Licence courses were introduced in 1996 and 1997 respectively.</h2>

    <h2>How To Be Prepared to be scouted for football.<br><br>
      I don't personally know how it feels to be scouted, but I know two cases of great players that didn't have a chance in the clubs. In the first case, this person was lucky enough to get a contract for sub-20, if I'm not mistaken, and he was a great player, even better than most in our current championship, but he didn't last long. Having a manager with connections is really important, if your gifts aren't innate as in Neymar or Messi. He lost his contract and didn't even manage to play an official match. In the second case, there was this kid that used to play for fun, but he was great, his only problem: he was too skinny. Even though fast and skilful, a powerful bash would drag him some meters, but Neymar was also like that in the beginning of his career. He went to the peneira (when the clubs are scouting for new talents), and he did great, scored, gave passes, great teamwork and the club called him. He went there, had to spend the whole day in the club, but they didn't offered him breakfast, lunch, nothing, not necessary to say he didn't last long on those conditions. Peneiras are really hard in here, if you don't have an innate talent it will make only more difficult.<br><br>
The scouts sometimes make mistakes too, do you know Luisito Suárez? That Uruguayan player that plays for Barcelona and scored 2 goals in the final? He could have passed on a Brazilian team before going to Europe, but the Brazilian scout that went looking for him said "he wasn't good enough".<br><br>
"Not good enough..."
